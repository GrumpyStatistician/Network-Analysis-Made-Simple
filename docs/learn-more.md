Thank you for making it this far!
We hope you've enjoyed the book.
If you want to further your learning,
here's a few resources to keep you going.

## Online Courses

=== "DataCamp"

    I have a course on DataCamp that you can use
    to get further practice.
    Signing up also supports me financially
    (that's my disclaimer),
    though the financial support also helps me make more
    programmer-oriented data science content for you!
    You can sign up at [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/)

## Academic Books

=== "Statistical Analysis of Network Data"

    This is an incredible resource for learning
    how to analyze graph data from a statistical viewpoint.
    It is written by Boston University's professor of mathematics
    Eric D. Kolaczyck.
    I used it during graduate school
    as part of my personnal learning journey.
    The book's website can be found [here](http://math.bu.edu/people/kolaczyk/SAND.html),
    and is available on Amazon.
